Summary of coding exercise

Things I was able to accomplish:
*making two columns to display blog posts, one for user's posts and one for other user posts
*making the design responsive (columns shift to one above and below in mobile view)
*writing unit/component tests for MOST of items
*adding in redux/state management (even though it was probably not necessary in small app)

Things I would do if I had more time:
*added a loading spinner while posts were loading
*found a way to demonstrate my knowledge of react hooks
*added better testing for redux/thunk/middleware. this was a little bit of a learning curve for me, so I ran out of time
*made UI even better

Things I would have done differenlty:
*not used redux (testing got difficult, and I don't think this small of an app needed it)
